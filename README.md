# Churn_Risk 📊🚀

Churn rate is a crucial metric in the marketing world, measuring the number of customers who leave a business over a specific time period. At Churn_Risk, we take this metric to the next level by predicting the likelihood of churn for each user. 🎯📈

## Overview 🌐

Every user is assigned a prediction value that estimates their state of churn at any given time. This value is based on:

1. User demographic information 📚
2. Browsing behavior 🕶️
3. Historical purchase data 🛍️
4. And other relevant information 📝

Our goal is to provide businesses with actionable insights to retain their customers effectively. 💼🔄
